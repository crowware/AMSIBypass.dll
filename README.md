# AMSIBypass.dll

**AMSIBypass.dll** is a Windows x64 dynamic-link library (DLL) that disables the AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) in-memory for the current process by patching the `AmsiScanBuffer` function. This is commonly used to allow unrestricted script execution in environments where Defender or AMSI-integrated AV solutions inspect runtime buffers (e.g., PowerShell, C# in-memory execution, etc).

This project is for educational and research purposes, such as evaluating endpoint visibility, testing security software, or understanding runtime patching in Windows processes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Patches `amsi.dll!AmsiScanBuffer` at runtime
- Sets `eax = 0; ret` to force AMSI to always return "clean"
- Auto-executes via `DllMain()` on `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`
- Built in C++ (Visual Studio 2022)
- x64-only (Windows 10/11)

## üß™ Usage

**1. Compile**

Open in **Visual Studio 2022**:
- Build as a DLL (Release/x64 recommended)
- Output: `AMSIBypass.dll`

**2. Inject**

Inject into a target process using any standard method (e.g., `CreateRemoteThread`, `rundll32`, or a custom loader):

```cpp
CreateRemoteThread(hProc, 0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)LoadLibraryA, (LPVOID)"C:\Path\AMSIBypass.dll", 0, 0);
```

Once loaded, the patch will immediately disable AMSI scanning in the host process.

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Working In

- `powershell.exe`
- `pwsh.exe`
- `wscript.exe`
- .NET apps executing dynamic code

---

## üõë Limitations

- Only affects **current process**; injection must be repeated for each new instance.
- Will not survive reboot or restart of the host process.
- May need updating if Windows internals change (function layout).
